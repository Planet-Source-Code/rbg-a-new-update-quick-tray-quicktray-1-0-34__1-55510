### Description

thisis an update to my last project, I have added drag and drop like someone asked, I also added a hard drive scanner to find certain types of folder, and a small beta screen to deleted and modify your current favorites. I am going to work on the GUI now, but please post any suggestions and I will build them in asap!!
